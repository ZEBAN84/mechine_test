Continuous Path Correction & Terrain Classification Project

 ## Project Overview

This project is designed to process and fix discontinuities in a set of latitude and longitude coordinates. These coordinates represent a path from Point A to Point B. The goal is to:


1. **Correct Discontinuities**: Automatically identify and correct coordinates that are out of a continuous path. --- you can check it out in q1.py file the code is explaind in the file accordigly
2. **Visualize the Data**: Plot the coordinates before and after correction on a map and compare the results.--- screenshot of the html file is in images/map.png
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Reading and fixing discontinuous coordinates.--- the fixed file is in
